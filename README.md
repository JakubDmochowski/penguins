# penguins

This is a penguin console game written in pure C (C99).

How to run: 
  - Compile the whole thing (for interactive mode in file define.h should be added: "#define INTERACTIVE)
  - If interactive mode is used, open .exe file and play, otherwise use command line to open .exe file with argument syntax: 
       {file}.exe phase={phase} penguins={numberOfPenguins} {inputFile}.txt {outputFile}.txt
          where {phase} is placement or movement
